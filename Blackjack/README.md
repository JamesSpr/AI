# Backstory

Originally completed in 2020 as a project for a university course.
 Submitted code is shown in the [original_university_project_files](https://github.com/JamesSpr/AI/Blackjack/original_university_project_files)

This was conducted as a group assignment. My assigned role was to complete the computer vision component,
with another member assigned to the reinforcement learning.

After review, the Reinforcement Learning actions were not updating. Due to this I have reworked in this repo.

# Local Development Setup
## Requirements
- Camera or Webcam

# Project Overview
**Aim**: To create a blackjack agent that can play against a human dealer.

## Computer Vision
Playing card detection and classification

### Dataset Creation

### Feature Extraction

### Object Recognition


## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning algorithm to output an action to the agent.


## Project Improvements
